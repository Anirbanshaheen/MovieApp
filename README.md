# MovieApp based on OMDP API

I have used Kotlin and MVVM architectural design pattern, I have also used Dagger-Hilt for Dependency Injection. For Navigation I have used the android navigation component.

The app contains 4 pages mainly. HomePage contains a caraousel of five movies and two rails of Batman and Latest movies by year.
Clicking on rail item will navigate to details page and View More button will navigate to list page with pagination triggered by scrolling.
From the details page by clicking the play button user will be redirected to streaming page. the streaming page can detect auto rotation without refreshing the player timline.

in Android Studio press "ctrl" + "shift" + "-" and then "ctrl" + "+" to view comments properly.
